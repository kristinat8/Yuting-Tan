My research focuses on developing unified representations for visual and linguistic grounding, enabling embodied AI to understand and interact with the open world. This includes projects like **EgoViT**, a self-supervised model for learning from egocentric video, and **PsyMem**, a psychologically-aligned LLM for human-like role-playing.
