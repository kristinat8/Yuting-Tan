Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am currently a Master's student at the Communication University of China and a Ph.D. applicant, focusing on enabling embodied AI systems to perceive, reason, and communicate like humans[cite: 4, 9]. [cite_start]My main research interest is developing unified representations for visual and linguistic grounding in open-world agents[cite: 7]. [cite_start]This includes projects like **EgoViT**, which learns object representations from egocentric video [cite: 5, 21][cite_start], and **PsyMem**, a psychologically-aligned LLM for advanced role-playing[cite: 6, 24].

Feel free to reach out via email or follow my latest updates on my social media platforms.
