<!-- I am passionate about demystifying complex topics in machine learning and empowering students to bridge the gap between theory and practice. My teaching approach centers on building strong foundational knowledge through hands-on, project-based learning and connecting core concepts to state-of-the-art research.

### Teaching Assistant, Deep Learning
*Communication University of China* | *Fall 2024 & Spring 2025*

In this core undergraduate course, I was responsible for helping students master both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of deep learning. My duties included:
* Mentoring over 40 undergraduate students through weekly office hours and lab sessions, providing hands-on guidance for their PyTorch projects ranging from foundational ResNets to advanced multi-object tracking systems.
* Guiding students in crucial research skills such as experimental design, debugging complex models, and interpreting results.
* Designing and updating course materials, including programming assignments on essential architectures like CNNs and YOLO. To connect the curriculum with current research, I developed new tutorial modules on advanced topics such as Vision Transformers and self-supervised learning.

### Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Computational Thinking
*Communication University of China* | *Fall 2023*

This course aimed to provide foundational computer science skills to students from non-technical backgrounds. My role was to make programming and algorithmic thinking accessible and engaging.
* I developed a series of Python programming assignments tailored for non-CS majors, focusing on practical, scenario-driven exercises to build foundational algorithmic reasoning skills without requiring an extensive programming background. -->
